Ryan was very hungry. Ryan went to Union South and bought pizza. Unfortunately, Ryan tripped and dropped his pizza.
Ryan was so upset he kicked the pizza.
Then he threw it in one of the giant puddles that are at every crosswalk on campus.
After doing this he thought, "I'm still really hungry".
He was so hungry, he decided he was going to eat the pizza anyway.

But he was run out of money for a new pizza. "So I have to find a ATM at first." He thought. 

He walks around Union South until he finds an ATM, but there is a huge line waiting there.
As he waits in line he realizes that he doesn't have his ATM card on him and starts to panic. He 
decides to then run back to his room and get it.
